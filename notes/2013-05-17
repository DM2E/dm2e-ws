* Communication objects (*Pojo) are pretty much complete
* RDF API needs improvement
* proper export of GLiteral-typed properties
* List import makes the containig class a list
* Easy way to get the full URI of something with prefixed RDFId
* POJOs should implement hashCode to make retrieving them easier
* consider UUID for id generation in some cases
* Write proper unit tests
* Implement Workflow Job execution logic
** Generate one slot for every position/webservice/param combination
** Decide which slots to generate for input params of workflow
** Check whether data flow has no gaps (connectedness of the slots)
** Validate input params (correct type)
* Use Grafeo's getCanonicalNTriples to compare RDF output for equality
